**Kaggle Playground October 2024** - Loan Approval Prediction

[About October Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e10)

**Goal:** The goal for this competition is to predict whether an applicant is approved for a loan.

**Evaluation:** Submissions are evaluated using area under the ROC curve using the predicted probabilities and the ground truth targets.

**Learnings:**
- Handle class imbalance with SMOTE() and scale_pos_weight parameters in algorithms
- Use predict_proba in Gradient Boosting
- Use Pipeline and Column Transformer
